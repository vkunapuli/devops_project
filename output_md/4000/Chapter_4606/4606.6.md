> If the energy improvements are related to renewable energy sources,
> including solar panels, water efficiency devices, wind turbines or
> geothermal systems, and an energy report is not available to
> demonstrate their cost effectiveness, the cost effectiveness may be
> demonstrated by obtaining copies of all invoices and/or receipts, as
> applicable, for the cost of the systems or devices and comparing the
> cost of the systems or devices, including maintenance, to the income
> produced over the life of the systems or devices. When the income
> produced exceeds the net cost (including any tax credits and rebates)
> of the systems or devices, the cost effectiveness has been
> demonstrated. The appraiser must document the projected income by
> utilizing PV Value, Ei Value, or a similar tool as referenced in
> Section 5601.4.

for the Seller-Owned Converted Mortgage should consist of the following:

Seller represents and warrants that the instrument, when completed,
contains substantially identical provisions to the Freddie Mac Agreement
to Convert and is appropriate for use to evidence the conversion of the
Convertible ARM; and

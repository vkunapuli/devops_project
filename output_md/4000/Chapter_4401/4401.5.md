> before adding the Margin in calculating the rate
>
> ■For all SOFR-indexed ARMs, the Seller must inform the Borrower in
> writing on or before the Note Date and in each Note Rate adjustment
> notice that the Index value used to calculate the new Note Rate for
> each Interest Change Date is:
>
> ❑The 30-day Average SOFR as published by, or on the website of, the
> Federal Reserve Bank of New York

**(c)Limits on Note Rate adjustments**

> the Lifetime Floor, which must equal the Margin as required by Section
> 4401.4(f)
>
> 2.The Note Rate at the first Interest Change Date may not exceed the
> value of the Note Rate at origination plus the Initial Cap or be less
> than the value of the Note Rate at origination minus the Initial Cap
>
> 3.Adjustments on subsequent Interest Change Dates are subject to the
> Periodic Cap

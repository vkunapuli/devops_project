> 2\. The Note is negotiable, and the entire indebtedness, including all
> amounts capitalized, is fully enforceable against the Borrower and
> secured by a First Lien
>
> 3\. The UPB of the Mortgage, including all amounts capitalized, does
> not exceed the original loan amount as reflected in the Note

> be included in a 10-, 15-, 20- or 30-year Pool) following the Delivery
> Date. If, as a result of the capitalization, the Note maturity date

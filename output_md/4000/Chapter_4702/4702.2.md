>
> If a preliminary binder or commitment is issued, it must be issued by
> the same title insurer that issues the final title insurance policy.
>
> Selection or acceptance of the title insurance company by the Seller
> must be based solely on considerations, such as the comprehensiveness
> of the policy, the financial ability of the company to stand behind
> its commitment, the company's record on settling claims and other
> considerations normally employed by institutional investors
> originating or purchasing Mortgages in the jurisdiction where the
> Mortgaged Premises are located. The selection or acceptance must not
> be based on receipt of any fee or other consideration by the Seller or

**(b)Amount of protection**

> The title insurance policy must protect the mortgagee up to at least
> the current principal balance of the Mortgage.

**(c)Insured**

> The title insurance protection must run to Freddie Mac for Mortgages
> purchased in their entirety by Freddie Mac.
>
> If a Mortgage is registered with MERS® and is originated naming MERS
> as original mortgagee of record, solely as nominee for the Lender
> named in the Security Instrument and the Note, and Lender's successors
> and assigns, then the "insured Mortgage" covered by the title
> insurance policy must be identified in the title insurance policy as
> the Security\
> Instrument given to MERS, solely as nominee for Lender and Lender's
> successors and assigns. However, under no circumstances may MERS be
> named as an insured in a title insurance policy.
>
> Furthermore, if a Mortgage is registered with MERS, the
> Seller/Servicer must arrange for all insurance drafts, notices,
> policies, invoices, etc., to be delivered directly to the\
> Seller/Servicer. Although the MERS address appears in local public
> land records, the address for MERS must not be given to organizations
> that normally direct mail to the Seller/Servicer or Servicing Agent.

>
> ■Effective for Mortgages with Note Dates up to December 31, 2023,

> (e.g., Seller cannot deliver a 2021 Loan Policy in New York until the
> State of New York has approved use of that form policy).

modified (03/02/16)**

The Mortgage must be a valid First Lien on the Mortgaged Premises. The
Mortgaged Premises must be free and clear of all prior liens and
encumbrances and no rights or condition may exist that could give rise
to such liens, except for:

■Liens for real estate taxes and special assessments not yet due and
payable

■Rights and conditions specified in Section 4702.4

The Mortgage must be a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Borrower, enforceable according to its terms and conditions, and free
from any right of setoff, counterclaim or other claim or defense. No
part of the Mortgaged Premises may have been released from the Mortgage.

The terms of the Mortgage may not in any material manner have been
modified, amended or in any way waived or changed, except as permitted
by Freddie Mac for Mortgages eligible for sale as Construction
Conversion Mortgages or Renovation Mortgages which use Modification
Construction Conversion Documentation, Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages,
Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages or refinance Mortgages secured by
property in New York State that are documented using a New York

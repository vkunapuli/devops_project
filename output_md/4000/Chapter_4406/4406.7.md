(TLTV) and Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) TLTV (HTLTV) ratios on
properties that are subject to resale restrictions (12/06/23)**

**(a)Resale restrictions survive foreclosure or recordation of a
deed-in-lieu of foreclosure**

> For a purchase transaction when an appraisal is obtained, value is the
> lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the Mortgaged
> Premises. When an appraisal waiver is offered and accepted, value is
> the purchase price of the Mortgaged Premises.
>
> For a refinance transaction when an appraisal is obtained, value is
> the appraised value of the Mortgaged Premises. When an appraisal
> waiver is offered and accepted, value is the estimated value of the
> Mortgaged Premises submitted by the Seller.

**(b)Resale restrictions terminate upon foreclosure (or expiration of
any applicable legally** **required foreclosure redemption period) or
recordation of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure**

> For purchase and refinance transactions, value is the appraised value
> of the Mortgaged Premises without resale restrictions as determined in
> accordance with the appraisal requirements of Section 4406.6(b).
>
> The LTV ratio is obtained by dividing the First Lien Mortgage amount
> by the appraised value as illustrated below:

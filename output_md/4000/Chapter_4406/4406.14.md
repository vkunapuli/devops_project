**4406.14: Loan purpose for Mortgages secured by properties subject to
income-based resale restrictions (12/06/23)**

A Mortgage secured by a property subject to an income-based resale
restricted property may be a purchase, "no cash-out" or cash-out
refinance transaction.

"No cash-out" and cash-out refinance transactions are permitted with
prior written approval of the transaction from the subsidy provider or
program administrator. The Mortgage file must contain evidence of the
required approval and the approved amount of the proceeds that the
Borrower may receive.

Proceeds from a "no cash-out" refinance transaction may be used to pay
the unpaid principal amount used to subsidize the purchase price of the
property at the time the Borrower purchased the Mortgaged Premises and
any required share of the appreciation due to the subsidy provider per
the resale restricted covenants. See Section 4301.4.

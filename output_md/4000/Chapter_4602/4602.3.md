> The Seller may use the applicable Freddie Mac Construction Conversion

> requires that a new Uniform Note be used.
>
> If the Seller uses a different Construction Conversion Modification
> Agreement than those described above to evidence the terms of the

>
> ■Contains substantially identical provisions to the comparable Freddie

> ■Is appropriate for use to evidence the conversion of Interim

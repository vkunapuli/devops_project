**4202.3: Predatory lending practices (07/01/21)**

Freddie Mac actively opposes predatory lending and has implemented a
number of policies designed to combat it. Freddie Mac-approved
Seller/Servicers should have policies designed to identify and avoid
predatory lending practices.

To further implement certain Freddie Mac anti-predatory lending
policies, when selling a Mortgage to Freddie Mac, a Seller represents
and warrants with respect to Mortgages with Application Received Dates
on or after January 10, 2014:

■Compliance with the requirements of Sections 1301.2, 4202.1, 4202.2,
4202.4, 4202.5, 4202.6, 4202.7, 4202.9, and 4301.2; and

■No Borrower who qualified for a lower-cost loan product has been
"steered" to a higher-cost loan product. A Seller should offer or direct
applicants who seek financing through the Seller's higher-priced
subprime or non-prime lending channel toward its standard Mortgage line
if the applicants qualify for one of the standard products.

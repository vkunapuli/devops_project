4603.2.

Unless specifically prohibited, the special negotiated Mortgage
underwriting provisions, products and offerings described in the
Purchase Documents may be used with super conforming Mortgages provided
that the more restrictive provisions of this chapter or the Seller's
other Purchase Documents apply.

Unless otherwise notified in writing, Sellers are eligible to deliver
super conforming Mortgages.

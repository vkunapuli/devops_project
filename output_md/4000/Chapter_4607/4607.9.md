**CHOICERenovation® Mortgages (06/01/22)**

The Seller must obtain an appraisal report based on an interior and
exterior inspection. The appraisal report must include an "as completed"
value of the subject property. If there are proposed renovations being
financed with the CHOICERenovation® Mortgage, the appraisal report must
be completed subject to completion of the proposed renovations.

The Seller must provide the appraiser with the cost estimates, plans and
specifications for the renovations.

If, after the appraiser provides the "as completed" value, changes are
made to the original plans and specifications in accordance with Section
4607.10(a)(ii), the Seller must notify the appraiser of the changes and
provide change documentation to the appraiser. The appraiser must
provide a new appraisal to reflect the changes and account for the
impact on the "as completed" value.

Upon completion of all proposed renovations, the appraiser must perform
a final inspection of the property in accordance with Section 5605.8 and
complete a certification of completion. The completion report must
document that all renovations were completed in accordance with the
plans and specifications and must include photographs of the completed
renovations.

> "no cash-out" refinance transaction, remaining proceeds may be
> disbursed to the Borrower, provided the total amount disbursed to the
> Borrower at closing and from the unused funds does not exceed the
> maximum amount allowed under Section 4301.4. If the Borrower funded
> the contingency reserve with his or her own funds, he or she may

>
> ■Document that additional renovations were paid for from the
> completion escrow account or Custodial Account for Renovation Funds,
> as applicable, and verify the funds are being used to further improve
> the Mortgaged Premises, and
>
> ■Verify the additional renovation work has been completed by obtaining
> a completion report pursuant to Section 4607.9
>
> If the CHOICERenovation Mortgage is delinquent, any unused funds
> (including contingency reserve funds provided by the Borrower, if
> applicable) must be applied in accordance with the application of
> payment requirements in the Note and Security Instrument. After the
> CHOICERenovation Mortgage is brought current, any remaining unused
> funds (including contingency reserve funds not provided by the
> Borrower) may be used to reduce the UPB or used for additional
> renovations (as noted above).

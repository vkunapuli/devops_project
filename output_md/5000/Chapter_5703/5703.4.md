**(a)Real property requirements**\
To be eligible for sale to Freddie Mac, a Mortgage must be secured by a
perfected First Lien on real estate that consists of the Manufactured
Home and the land on which the\
Manufactured Home is permanently affixed, and the Manufactured Home must
be legally classified as real property under applicable State law,
including relevant statutes, regulations and judicial decisions.

> The Seller must be:\
> ■Familiar with, and comply with, all State laws and regulations and
> complete all steps necessary to ensure that all of the Mortgaged
> Premises, including the Manufactured Home, is real property\
> ■Aware of all State laws relating to titling the Manufactured Home and
> creating and perfecting liens on the Manufactured Home\
> If a State has laws, regulations or administrative policies that
> establish procedures allowing for the surrender and cancelation of the
> certificate of title, the Seller must comply with these procedures.
>
> If a State does not have procedures allowing for the surrender and
> cancelation of the certificate of title, the Seller must comply with
> requirements for evidencing and perfecting a lien on the Manufactured
> Home on the certificate of title.
>
> For example, if a State has laws, regulations or administrative
> policies that establish\
> procedures allowing for the surrender and cancelation of the
> certificate of title, the Borrower may have to file an evidence of

> converted to real property. Alternatively, a State may require a
> foundation form to be recorded in the land records and filed with the
> agency governing manufactured housing to complete the process for
> converting it to real property.
>
> A Mortgage secured by a real estate lien on a Manufactured Home
> evidenced and perfected using a certificate of title is eligible for
> sale to Freddie Mac only if a State has no statutory, regulatory or
> formal administrative process for surrendering and canceling a
> certificate of title or exemption of a Manufactured Home from the
> certificate of title requirements.
>
> The taxation of the Mortgaged Premises as real property is not
> evidence that all the appropriate steps to convert a Manufactured Home
> to real property have been completed or that a Manufactured Home is
> legally classified as real property.

**(b)Real property classification**

> Generally, a State will classify or recognize a Manufactured Home as
> real property using one of the following approaches:
>
> **(i)Non-certificate of title States**
>
> The Manufactured Home is classified as real property when it meets the
> requirements imposed by the State, including but not limited to, the
> permanent attachment of the Manufactured Home to the land. The State
> does not require that the owner of the Manufactured Home obtain a
> certificate of title for the Manufactured Home ("non-certificate of
> title States").
>
> In non-certificate of title States, title to the Manufactured Home is
> evidenced and conveyed by deed, and the lien on the Manufactured Home
> and the land is created and perfected by a recorded Security
> Instrument.
>
> **(ii)Certificate of title surrender States**
>
> The Manufactured Home is classified as real property when it meets the
> requirements imposed by the State, including but not limited to:
>
> ■The Manufactured Home is permanently affixed to the land
>
> ■The certificate of title is surrendered to the appropriate State
> agency, and
>
> ■The certificate of title is canceled by the State agency
> ("certificate of title surrender States")
>
> Some certificate of title surrender States also provide for an
> exemption from the issuance of a certificate of title upon the
> surrender of the manufacturer's statement of origin if the
> Manufactured Home is permanently affixed to the land and meets the
> other requirements for a surrender and cancelation of a certificate of
> title.

> In certificate of title surrender States, after the certificate of
> title has been canceled or otherwise exempted, title to the
> Manufactured Home is evidenced and conveyed by deed, and the lien on
> the Manufactured Home and the land is created and perfected by a
> recorded Security Instrument.
>
> **(iii) Certificate of title States**
>
> The Manufactured Home is recognized as part of the real property when
> it meets the requirements imposed by the State, including but not
> limited to:
>
> ■The Manufactured Home is permanently affixed to the land, and
>
> ■The Manufactured Home meets all other conditions to be legally
> recognized as real property when a certificate of title has been
> issued by the State but not surrendered ("certificate of title
> States")
>
> In a certificate of title State, the State does not have procedures
> allowing for the surrender and cancelation of the certificate of
> title.
>
> In a certificate of title State:
>
> ■Ownership of the Manufactured Home is shown on the certificate of
> title and ownership of the land is shown on the recorded deed to the
> real property
>
> ■Transfer of ownership of the Manufactured Home is either noted on the
> certificate of title or by the issuance of a new certificate of title
> showing the purchaser as the owner, and transfer of ownership of the
> land is done through a recorded deed of transfer
>
> ■The lien on the land is created by the Security Instrument and is
> evidenced and perfected by recording the Security Instrument in the
> land records. The lien on the Manufactured Home is created by the same
> Security Instrument but is evidenced and perfected by its notation on
> the certificate of title to the Manufactured Home and/or filing with
> the appropriate State agency, or another specified method.

**(c)Documentation requirements**

> In all cases, notwithstanding the different processes required by
> State law, the Seller must maintain in the Mortgage file documentation
> evidencing that:
>
> ■The Manufactured Home is legally classified as real property
>
> ■The Manufactured Home is properly titled; and

> property, and
>
> ■Evidence that a certificate of title has not been issued such as the
> manufacturer's statement of origin (provided that the manufacturer's

> agency)

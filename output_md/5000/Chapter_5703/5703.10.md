> Mac.

**(e) Cost approach for Manufactured Homes**

> A detailed cost approach to value based on published sources and
> supported by market data is required for all Manufactured Home
> appraisals. The appraisal report must, at a minimum, provide the
> information indicated on Form 70B and provide sufficient information
> and data to allow the Seller or other reviewers to replicate the cost
> figures and calculations. The appraiser should fully develop the cost
> approach to support quality of construction\
> determinations and any adjustments made by the appraiser to account
> for differences in quality of construction.
>
> The cost figures must come directly from a published cost service
> without modification by the appraiser. The appraiser must report the
> source of the cost data and the effective date of cost data.
>
> The appraiser must use the cost data to provide a quality rating that
> is based only on objective criteria. The appraiser may use other
> sources of objective information, such as the Uniform Appraisal
> Dataset Specifications (as found in Exhibit 36, Condition and Quality
> Ratings and Level of Updating Definitions) ratings and definitions, to
> support the quality rating.
>
> The appraiser must provide an opinion of site value supported by a
> summary of comparable land sales or other methods used for estimating
> site value.

**(f)Income approach for Manufactured Homes**

> The income approach to value is not required; however, the appraiser
> must consider the income approach to value and develop it if
> applicable and necessary to develop a credible report.

**(g)Completion documentation for Manufactured Homes**

> If the appraisal is performed before the Manufactured Home is
> delivered and installed on a permanent foundation, the Seller must
> document that the Manufactured Home is complete. If a new appraisal is
> required, the appraiser must provide an analysis of previously
> unavailable information. If the new appraisal is an appraisal update
> that also acts as documentation of completion, the appraiser must
> state that the conditions of the underlying appraisal have been
> satisfied.

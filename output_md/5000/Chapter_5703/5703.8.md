> other non-purchase transaction less than 12 months prior to the
> Application Received Date, the Seller must obtain appropriate
> documentation to verify the acquisition and transfer of ownership of
> the land. In such event, the value of the land will be its current

> contribution is the lesser of 90% of the retail value based on the
> N.A.D.A. Manufactured Housing Appraisal Guide or the lowest price at
> which the Manufactured Home was sold during that 12-month period
>
> Any costs resulting from the removal of the Manufactured Home or any

> ownership and existence of liens on the Manufactured Home and land, if
> included. The seller of the New Manufactured Home must provide proof
> of title transfer and satisfaction of any existing liens on the traded
> Manufactured Home.

**(c)Layering of risk**

> A Manufactured Home adds a layer of collateral risk that must be
> considered when\
> evaluating the overall risk of the Mortgage using the three Cs of
> underwriting (credit reputation, capacity and collateral). The Seller
> must consider this high-risk characteristic in evaluating the overall
> risk of the Mortgage and avoid combining a Manufactured Home with

Freddie Mac *Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide* Chapter 5703 As of
02/07/24 Page 5703-18

> weaknesses in the components of capacity and credit reputation. See
> Section 5102.2 for more information on evaluating layering of risk and
> how to document that the overall risk of the Mortgage is acceptable.
>
> For example, a Mortgage secured by a Manufactured Home with maximum
> financing is acceptable if the Borrower has a strong credit reputation
> and strong capacity to offset the high risk within the collateral
> component. However, if the Borrower has weaknesses in credit
> reputation, such as a credit history of short duration or derogatory
> credit information, the layering of risk across credit reputation and
> collateral is excessive and would make the Mortgage unacceptable.

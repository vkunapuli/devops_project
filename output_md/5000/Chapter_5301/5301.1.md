**5301.1: General requirements for all stable monthly income
(11/01/23)**

**(a)Analysis of stable monthly income amount**

> The analysis, verification, calculation and determination of the
> stable monthly income amount is integral to the overall qualification
> of the Borrower and determination of the Borrower's capacity to repay
> the Mortgage and other monthly obligations.
>
> Topic 5300 provides requirements and guidance for the determination of
> stable monthly income. The Seller must determine when additional
> analysis and documentation is needed to support the determination of
> stable and consistent monthly income.
>
> If the Borrower is obligated to pay alimony and has more than 10
> months remaining, the amount of the monthly alimony payment must be
> deducted from the stable monthly income. See Section 5401.2(a)(3).

**(b)General requirements for all stable monthly income**

> Stable monthly income is the Borrower's verified gross monthly income
> from all acceptable and verifiable sources that can reasonably be
> expected to continue for at least the next three years. For each
> income source used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must determine
> that both the source and the amount of the income are stable, with a
> consistent level of earnings.
>
> Income that is paid to the Borrower in cryptocurrency may not be used
> for qualification.
>
> Regardless of the underwriting path, the income used to qualify the
> Borrower (whether or not specifically addressed in Topic 5300) and the
> documentation in the Mortgage file must be evaluated for stable
> monthly income qualification requirements and must meet the\
> requirements of Topic 5300. Income that does not meet these
> requirements or is not\
> calculated correctly may invalidate the Loan Product Advisor Risk
> Class on the Feedback Certificate.
>
> The Seller must include a written analysis of the income and amount in
> the Mortgage file. A written analysis includes topics such as:
>
> ■The calculation used to determine the qualifying income, unless it
> can be clearly derived from documentation in the Mortgage file (e.g.,
> Social Security pre-determined payment amounts, annual salary); and

>
> ■The rationale for determining that the source and the amount of the
> income are stable, including any rationale applicable to the
> stability, history, calculation and continuance of the income
>
> In addition, all documentation used to establish stable monthly income
> must be retained in the Mortgage file.

**(c)Income stability and history requirements**

> The Seller must consider the length of history of the income and
> whether the earnings have been level and consistent. When evaluating
> stability of income based upon historical receipt, additional layering
> of risk may be present depending upon thedegree of income fluctuation.
>
> As a result, the Seller must determine when additional documentation
> (e.g., an additional year of earnings history) is necessary to support
> income stability.
>
> In most instances, a two-year history of receiving a consistent level
> of income is required in order for the income to be considered stable
> and used for qualifying. While the source of income may vary, the
> Borrower must have a consistent level of income despite changes in the
> sources of income.

**(d)Continuance**

> For all income used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must determine
> whether the income is reasonably expected to continue. This
> determination must focus on the Borrower's past
> employment/self-employment history, history of receipt of other income
> and the probability of continued consistent receipt of the income used
> to qualify the Borrower. At a minimum, the Seller must base the
> determination on the requirements of Topic 5300, and any other
> documentation contained in the Mortgage file. Additional documentation
> may be required, as described in Section 5302.1.
>
> The Seller may consider all income for qualifying the Borrower,
> provided the Seller does not have knowledge, information or
> documentation that contradicts a reasonable expectation of continuance
> or probability of consistent receipt over at least the next three
> years.
>
> Continuance of income is categorized as follows:
>
> ■Income and earnings types typically without documentable continuance
> (likely to continue) (**Chart A**)
>
> ■Income types with documentable continuance (**Chart B**)
>
> ■Income types that may or may not have documentable continuance,
> depending upon the source (e.g., government program, private insurer)
> and terms of the specific income type (e.g., retirement, long-term
> disability) (**Chart C**)

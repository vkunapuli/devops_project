> transaction history must identify the name of the institution and the
> source, and includes the information required above for asset account
> statements, unless:
>
> ❒It is used in combination with other asset verifications containing
> the missing information, and
>
> ❒It can clearly establish that the transaction history pertains to the
> same account
>
> **(ii)Third-party asset verifications**
>
> Asset verifications obtained through third-party verification service
> providers are acceptable. The verifications must be received by the
> originator directly from the third-party verification service provider
> and must contain the same information as required for direct account
> verifications or asset account statements aboveexcept as follows for
> verifications that are generated electronically and are not completed

> two digits of the account number

> additional documentation to supplement the third-party verification.
> The Seller is responsible for ensuring the accuracy and integrity of
> the information provided by the third-party verification services.

> **(iii)Evaluation of deposits in the Borrower's accounts**
>
> **(A)Deposits requiring verification**
>
> Except as stated below, the Seller is not required to document the
> sources of\
> unverified deposits for purchase or refinance transactions. However,
> when qualifying the Borrower, the Seller must consider any liabilities
> resulting from all borrowed funds.
>
> For all transactions, when an unverified deposit is used to pay off or
> pay down an existing debt in order to qualify for the Mortgage, the
> source of funds must be documented.
>
> For purchase transactions, when evaluating deposits in the Borrower's
> accounts, the following requirements apply:
>
> ■The Seller must document the source of funds for any "large deposit,"
> as\
> described below, if the deposit is needed to qualify the Borrower for
> the Mortgage transaction (i.e., any funds required to be paid by the
> Borrower and Borrower reserves)
>
> A "large deposit" is any single deposit exceeding 50% of the sum of:
>
> ❑The total monthly qualifying income for the Mortgage and
>
> ❑The amount derived from the asset calculation for establishing the
> debt payment-to-income ratio in accordance with the requirements of
> Section 5307.1, if applicable
>
> ■When a single deposit consists of both verified and unverified
> portions, the Seller may use just the unverified amount when
> determining whether the deposit is a large deposit as described above
>
> ■When a large deposit is not verified and is not needed to qualify the
> Borrower for the Mortgage transaction (i.e., any funds required to be
> paid by the Borrower and Borrower reserves), the Seller must reduce
> the funds used for qualification purposes by the amount of the
> unverified deposit. For Loan Product Advisor®Mortgages, the Seller
> must enter the reduced amount of the asset into Loan Product Advisor.

Freddie Mac *Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide* Chapter 5501 As of
02/07/24 Page 5501-6

> ■When the source of funds can be clearly identified from the deposit
> information on the account statement (e.g., direct payroll deposits)
> or other documented income or asset source in the Mortgage file (e.g.,
> tax refund amounts appearing on the tax returns in the file), the
> Seller is not required to obtain additional\
> documentation.

**(B)Acceptable sources of deposit**\
When a deposit requires verification as stated above, the Seller must
determine: ■Whether the source of the deposit is acceptable\
■That the funds belong to the Borrower, and\
■That the funds are eligible for the transaction\
Acceptable sources include, but are not limited to:\
■The Borrower's income\
■Funds awarded to the Borrower (e.g., disaster relief funds, lottery
winnings, court- awarded settlement) provided the source is not an
interested party to the real estate or Mortgage transaction\
■Funds derived from eligible asset types stated in Sections 5501.3(b)
and 5501.3(c) below\
**(b)Special requirements for Borrower personal funds**\
**(i)Minimum Borrower contribution**\
For a purchase transaction Mortgage, the Borrower must make a minimum
contribution from Borrower personal funds when specifically required in
the Guide, as summarized in the chart below.

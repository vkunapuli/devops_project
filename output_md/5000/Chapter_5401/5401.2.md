**(c)Evaluating debt ratios**

> Loan Product Advisor calculates and evaluates the Borrower's
> qualifying ratios. For Accept Mortgages, Loan Product Advisor has
> determined that the Borrower's qualifying ratios are acceptable.
>
> For Manually Underwritten Mortgages, the Seller must evaluate the
> Borrower's ability to pay the monthly housing expense and other
> obligations. When the Borrower's monthly debt payment to income ratio
> exceeds 45%, the loan is ineligible for sale to Freddie Mac. As a
> guideline, the monthly debt payment-to-income ratio should not be
> greater than 33% to 36% of the Borrower's stable monthly income.
>
> When the Borrower's monthly debt payment-to-income ratio exceeds 36%,
> the Seller must document in the file the justification for the higher
> qualifying ratio.
>
> Except in rare circumstances, the Borrower's debt payment-to-income
> ratio should not exceed 36% for the following Mortgages:
>
> ■Cash-out refinance Mortgages
>
> ■Mortgages secured by 2- to 4-unit properties
>
> ■Mortgages where there is evidence that the Borrower increases debt
> and then periodically uses refinance or debt consolidation loans to
> reduce payments to a manageable level
>
> The following factors may be considered in justifying a debt
> payment-to-income ratio that exceeds 36% but is not greater than 45%:
>
> ■The Mortgage is secured by an energy efficient property, as described
> in Section 5401.1
>
> ■The Borrower's probability for increased earnings based on education,
> job training or time employed or practiced in a profession
>
> ■Documented rent paid by Related Persons living in the house
>
> ■The Borrower demonstrated ability to carry a higher housing expense
> or higher debt level while maintaining a good credit history for at
> least 12 months

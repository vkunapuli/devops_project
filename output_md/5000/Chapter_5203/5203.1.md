**5203.1: Credit reports (05/04/22)**
>
> For Manually Underwritten and Loan Product Advisor® Mortgages, each
> Mortgage file submitted to Freddie Mac must contain one or more
> written credit reports meeting the requirements of this section.
>
> The Seller must determine that the consumer reporting agency/bureau or
> credit repositories accessed the correct credit file by confirming the
> Borrower's identifying information (name, current and previous address
> and Social Security number) on the credit reports returned. The Seller
> is required to re-request the credit reports if a data entry error was
> made, or if the credit reports contain incorrect identifying
> information.
>
> **(a)Repository of credit information**
>
> A repository of credit information is an organization engaged
> primarily in gathering, recording, updating, storing and distributing
> financial and public record information concerning the debt repayment
> histories of individuals being considered for credit extension. The
> following national organizations meet this definition:
>
> ■Equifax Credit Information Services, Inc.
>
> ■Experian Information Solutions, Inc.
>
> ■Trans Union
>
> **(b)Consumer reporting agency or bureau**
>
> A consumer reporting agency is an organization engaged in the
> preparation and sale of credit reports used by credit grantors to
> determine the credit and public record history of an individual. These
> reports contain data obtained from the repositories of credit
> information. The reports may also contain information and
> verifications obtained from other sources.
>
> **(c)In-file credit reports**
>
> An in-file credit report is issued by a credit repository and contains
> "as is"\
> information which is information that has not been updated or
> re-verified as a result of a credit inquiry.
>
> If the Seller chooses to use in-file credit reports for a Manually
> Underwritten Mortgage, Freddie Mac requires the Seller to obtain
> reports from at least two credit repositories for each Borrower.

> **(d)Merged credit reports**
>
> A merged credit report is issued by a credit repository or a consumer
> reporting agency or bureau and includes the credit information from at
> least two credit repositories. A merged credit report includes all
> credit repository credit data for an individual Borrower. A joint
> merged credit report includes all credit repository credit data on two
> individual Borrowers.
>
> The credit information from each credit repository may be presented in
> a stacked merged credit report (that is, all records from all
> repositories are included in the report), or the consumer reporting
> agency or bureau may eliminate duplicate records through an automated
> merge process. Each consumer reporting agency or bureau may have a
> slightly different merge logic to eliminate duplicate records.
>
> If the Seller chooses to use merged or joint merged credit reports,
> Freddie Mac requires the credit repository or consumer reporting
> agency or bureau to obtain reports from at least two credit
> repositories for each Borrower.
>
> **(e)Residential Mortgage Credit Report**
>
> A Residential Mortgage Credit Report (RMCR) is a detailed account of
> the credit, employment and residence history as well as public records
> information prepared by a consumer reporting agency for an individual
> Borrower or two individual Borrowers.
>
> The RMCR was designed for use in mortgage financing of 1- to 4-unit
> dwellings.
>
> Credit information from two national repositories is merged and
> verified by a consumer reporting agency or bureau before it is sent to
> the user. The consumer reporting agency or bureau may also verify
> other information not contained in repository records.
>
> **(f)Credit report standards**
>
> All credit reports must meet the applicable standards from the
> following table:

> from Loan Product Advisor and the credit reports obtained outside of
> Loan Product Advisor.
>
> The Seller may use any of the above credit reports to assess the
> Borrower's credit reputation and to calculate total monthly debt

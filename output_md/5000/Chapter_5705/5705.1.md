**5705.1: Cooperative Share Loans (09/18/23)**

Freddie Mac purchases Cooperative Share Loans secured by an ownership
interest in Cooperative Projects that meet Freddie Mac's eligibility
requirements.

Sellers must obtain written approval to be eligible to deliver
Cooperative Share Loans to Freddie Mac. A Seller should contact its
Freddie Mac representative or the Customer Support Contact Center at
800-FREDDIE to discuss how to obtain the applicable term of business.
Freddie Mac reserves the right to cease approving Sellers or accepting
deliveries of Cooperative Share Loans from any or all Sellers.

The term "Mortgage" as used in the Guide includes as the context
requires the term "Cooperative Share Loan." Requirements pertaining to
Mortgages apply to Cooperative Share Loans.

**(a)Seller's assessment of project risks**

> Freddie Mac requires a Cooperative Project review to address certain
> project risks\
> including, but not limited to, the marketability and condition of the
> project, the marketability of the units within the project, the
> financial stability and viability of the project, project-level
> litigation, restrictions on Shareholders' rights to occupy the unit,
> and the adequacy of insurance coverage to protect the project from
> damage and loss.
>
> Freddie Mac expects the Seller to have staff that is experienced and
> knowledgeable about Cooperative Project risks and to place as much
> emphasis on the adequacy of the\
> Cooperative Interest as collateral as it does on underwriting the
> Borrower's\
> creditworthiness. The quality of a Cooperative Share Loan can be
> impacted by the financial stability and viability of the particular
> project, among other project characteristics. The conclusion that a
> Cooperative Share Loan is acceptable to Freddie Mac must be based on
> the determination that the Borrower is creditworthy and the
> Cooperative Interest in the Cooperative Corporation is adequate
> collateral for the Cooperative Share Loan transaction.

**(b)Seller Approval for Cooperative Share Loans**

> To be approved to sell Cooperative Share Loans, Sellers/Servicers must
> meet minimum requirements to be considered for approval to sell
> Cooperative Share Loans, including:
>
> 1.Possess sufficient expertise with Cooperative Projects and
> Cooperative Share Loans, capacity and resources to ensure that the
> Cooperative Project is likely to be successful, does not expose
> Freddie Mac to material credit risk and meets eligibility requirements

> must address pre-sale and owner-occupancy requirements, declining
> market trends, project completion, and any other issues that layer

> 6.Maintain controls for monitoring performance of Cooperative Share
> Loans it originates (e.g., a 60-day Delinquency within the first three
> months or any 90 or more day\

> Project is located) is used as commercial or non-residential space.
>
> The division of the total commercial or non-residential square footage
> by the total square footage of the project or building will determine
> the total amount of commercial or non-residential space. In

> must determine:

■The total square footage of the project (or the building in which the
project is located)

> ■The square footage of the commercial or non-residential space; and
>
> ■The residential space square footage
>
> Below is a table illustrating what must be included or may be excluded
> from the calculation of commercial or non-residential space.

> involves only minor matters that do not affect the safety, structural
> soundness, functional use or habitability of the Cooperative Project,
> the Cooperative Project is eligible if the litigation or ADR
> proceeding is limited to one of the following:
>
> 1.The litigation amount is known, the insurance company has committed
> to provide the defense and the litigation amount is covered by the
> insurance policy;

> the defense; and (iii) that any potential monetary judgment against
> the Cooperative Corporation, or settlement with the Cooperative
> Corporation, including punitive damages will likely be covered by the

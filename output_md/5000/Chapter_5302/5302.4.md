Under certain circumstances, the Taxpayer First Act requires that the
taxpayer's consent be obtained prior to the use and disclosure of the
taxpayer's tax return or tax return information to a third party. If
taxpayer consent is required under the Act, Sellers must ensure that the
form of consent obtained from the taxpayer permits the use and sharing
of the tax return or tax return information with and by any actual or
potential owners of the Mortgage, as well as their service providers,
successors and assigns. The signed consent form must be obtained in a
timely manner and placed in the Mortgage file. See Section 3301.11.

**(a)Tax return requirements**\
Tax returns must be:\
■The Borrower's signed copy of the U.S. federal income tax return(s)
that were most recently filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)\
■A complete tax return, including all applicable schedules and forms
(which includes all W-2s, K-1s and 1099s)\
The following are acceptable alternatives for the Borrower's signature
on the tax return(s): ■Evidence the tax returns were filed
electronically (e.g., signed Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature
Authorization or equivalent), or\
■Tax transcripts that validate the information on the unsigned tax
returns, or\
■A completed IRS Form 4506-C signed by the Borrower, or alternate form
acceptable to the IRS that authorizes the release of comparable tax
information to a third party

2 Alternative documentation is acceptable in lieu of the IRS
confirmation that tax transcript(s) are not yet available for the
business tax return(s), as follows:\
▪Confirmation business tax returns were filed after IRS filing due date
for the prior year(s) (e.g., 2022 business tax return in file was signed
later in the year (e.g., October)) or documentation from third-party tax
return preparer confirming 2023 business return has not yet been filed;
and\
▪Documented evidence of continued income stability using at least one of
the examples listed in Section 5304.1(d) in the row labeled "Business
and/or individual tax return(s) - most recent calendar year not yet
available"\
3 If the IRS extends the tax filing due date, evidence of the completed
IRS tax filing extension is required for Mortgages with Application
Received Dates on or after the IRS income tax filing due date and Note
Dates on or after the last day of the month following the IRS income tax
filing due date.

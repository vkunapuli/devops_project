**5701.1: Seller's assessment of project risks; terms used in this
chapter (12/08/23)**

**(a)Seller's assessment of project risks**

> Freddie Mac requires a Condominium Project review to address certain
> project risks including, but not limited to, the marketability and
> condition of the project, the marketability of the units within the
> project, the financial stability and viability of the project,
> project-level litigation, restrictions on unit owners' rights to
> occupy the unit, ownership and use of the Common Elements and
> Amenities and the adequacy of insurance coverage to protect the
> project from damage and loss.
>
> Freddie Mac expects the Seller to have staff that is experienced and
> knowledgeable about Condominium Project risks and to place as much
> emphasis on the adequacy of the property as collateral as it does on
> underwriting the Borrower's creditworthiness. The quality of a
> Mortgage secured by a unit in a Condominium Project can be impacted by
> the financial stability and viability of the particular project, among
> other project characteristics. The conclusion that a Mortgage is
> acceptable to Freddie Mac must be based on the determination that the
> Borrower is creditworthy and the Mortgaged Premises is adequate
> collateral for the Mortgage transaction.
>
> If a Seller determines that an Established Condominium Project does
> not meet certain Freddie Mac project eligibility requirements and
> concludes that the Mortgaged Premises is still adequate collateral for
> the Mortgage transaction, then the Seller may request that Freddie Mac
> consider a waiver. See Section 5701.11 for information on requesting
> Freddie Mac to consider a waiver of its project eligibility
> requirements.

> for a Project Certified Submission (PCS) review.
>
> **(ii)Green status**
>
> If Condo Project Advisor finds that the Condominium Project complies
> with all the requirements assessed for this status, Condo Project
> Advisor will assign a "Green" status to the project.
>
> **(iii)Yellow status**
>
> If Condo Project Advisor finds that the Condominium Project does not
> comply with one or more of the requirements assessed, Condo Project
> Advisor will assign a "Yellow" status to the project. The Condo
> Project Advisor Feedback Certificate will include a "Proceed with
> Caution" section with messages relating to requirements that need to
> be addressed before the Mortgage can be sold to Freddie Mac.
>
> If one of the messages indicates that the project may not be an
> Established Condominium Project, the Seller must first determine that
> the project complies with that requirement.
>
> If Seller determines that the project is an Established Condominium
> Project, fully analyzes the project review and general eligibility
> requirements identified on the Condo Project Advisor Feedback
> Certificate and determines that the project complies with the\
> requirement(s), the related Condominium Unit Mortgage may be eligible
> for sale to Freddie Mac.
>
> **(iv)Incomplete Assessment status**
>
> If Condo Project Advisor is unable to perform the assessment, Condo
> Project Advisor will assign an "Incomplete Assessment" status to the
> Condominium Project.
>
> A Mortgage secured by a Condominium Unit in a Condominium Project with
> an\
> "Incomplete Assessment" status may be eligible for sale to Freddie Mac
> if the Seller fully analyzes all project review requirements (Section
> 5701.2(a)) and general eligibility requirements (Section 5701.2(b))
> and determines the project complies with all the requirements. See
> Section 5701.10(h) for more details.
>
> **(v)Not Eligible status**
>
> If Condo Project Advisor finds that a Condominium Project does not
> meet certain Condominium Project review and general eligibility
> requirements, Condo Project Advisor will assign a "Not Eligible"
> status to the project. Mortgages secured by a Condominium Unit in a
> Condominium Project that receive this status are ineligible for sale
> to Freddie

> Mac and will be identified as such in Output (as defined in Section
> 2401.1(b)) of Condo Project Advisor, Loan Product Advisor, Loan
> Quality Advisor, and Loan Selling Advisor.
>
> A Condominium Project without a "Not Eligible" status does not mean
> that the project complies with all of Freddie Mac's project review and
> general eligibility requirements or that Freddie Mac will purchase any
> Mortgage secured by a Condominium Unit in that project. For a
> Condominium Project without a "Not Eligible" status, Seller must
> ensure compliance with all applicable requirements in this Chapter and
> all other requirements of the Purchase Documents.
>
> **(vi)Changes to PAR findings**
>
> For all PAR findings, including those submitted through the PCS review
> process, if a Seller or, if applicable, a Related Third Party, becomes
> aware of any information that could impact, or that is inconsistent
> with, a project's PAR findings, the Seller or Related Third Party must
> contact Freddie Mac at **[ProjectInfo@FreddieMac.com]{.underline}**
> and provide the specific information. Seller must notify Freddie Mac
> as soon as feasible but no later than five business days after Seller
> becomes aware of such information.
>
> A Condominium Project's PAR findings (status and/or feedback messages)
> may change based on information assessed after Condo Project Advisor
> assigns a status to the project and after Seller last accessed Condo
> Project Advisor and obtained a project's PAR findings.
>
> If the Seller or Related Third Party notified Freddie Mac of any
> information that could impact, or that is inconsistent with, a
> project's PAR findings, then, prior to sale of a Condominium Unit
> Mortgage secured by a unit in that Condominium Project, the Seller
> must confirm the Condominium Project's current PAR findings and ensure
> compliance with the requirement(s) specified on the Condo Project
> Advisor Feedback Certificate.

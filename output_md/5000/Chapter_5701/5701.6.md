**5701.6: New Condominium Projects (09/18/23)**

To be eligible for the New Condominium Projects review type, the
Condominium Project must meet the definition of a New Condominium
Project.

In addition to the project review and eligibility requirements in
Section 5701.2, Mortgages secured by Condominium Units in New
Condominium Projects must comply with all of the following requirements:

**(a)Project completion requirements**

> The subject legal phase (or the subject building) and any prior legal
> phases in which units have been offered for sale are substantially
> complete. "Substantially complete" indicates that the Common Elements
> are complete and the units are complete subject to the selection of
> buyer preference items.
>
> For the purpose of determining project completion under this Section
> 5701.6, a single building can only have one legal phase regardless of
> whether the Condominium Project is comprised solely of that single
> building or multiple buildings. Legal phases are defined by the
> Project Documents. Construction or marketing phases developed for the
> convenience of the developer are not necessarily legal phases and are
> not eligible.

**(b)Owner-occupancy requirements for New Condominium Projects**

> At least 50% of the total units in the project (or at least 50% of the
> sum of the subject legal phase and prior legal phases) must have been
> conveyed or must be under contract to purchasers who will occupy the
> units as their Primary Residences or second homes.
>
> For the purpose of calculating owner-occupancy under this Section
> 5701.6, a single building can only have one legal phase regardless of
> whether the Condominium Project is comprised solely of that single
> building or multiple buildings. Legal phases are defined by the
> Project

> following:
>
> 1.The homeowners association's (HOA's) assessments must begin once the
> developer has ceased to pay operating expenses attributable to the
> Condominium Project, whether or not all units have been sold. When any
> unit owner other than the developer pays assessments, the developer
> must pay the assessments attributable to the unsold units
>
> 2.The project's budget (or its projected budget if the project has not
> been turned over to the unit owners) must be consistent with the
> nature of the project
>
> 3.Appropriate assessments must be established to manage the project
>
> 4.There must be appropriate allocations for line items pertinent to

> the developer and/or purchasers of the Condominium Units, in an amount
> consistent with the estimated remaining life of the Common Elements
>
> 6.There must be adequate funding for insurance deductible amounts
>
> 7.At least 10% of the budget must provide funding for replacement
> reserves for capital expenditures and deferred maintenance based on
> the project's age, estimated remaining life and replacement cost of
> major Common Elements
>
> ■The replacement reserve percentage is determined by dividing (i) the
> annual budgeted replacement reserve allocation by (ii) the HOA's
> annual budgeted assessment income (including regular common expense
> fees)
>
> ■The calculation may exclude: (i) special assessment income, (ii)
> income allocated to or in reserve accounts, (iii) incidental income
> not relied upon for maintenance, operations or capital improvements
> and (iv) amounts collected from unit owners (but usually paid
> individually by them) for items or utilities such as internet access
>
> 8.If the budget does not provide a replacement reserve of at least
> 10%, a Seller may rely on either: (i) a reserve study, provided the
> conditions in Section 5701.6(k) below are met; or (ii) contributions
> to a working capital fund, provided the conditions in Section
> 5701.6(l) below are met. These contributions can be in addition to or
> in lieu of any working capital fund contributions made by the
> developer in the case of a recently converted project.

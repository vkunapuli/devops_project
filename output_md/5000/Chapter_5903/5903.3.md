**(a)Income calculations using tax returns obtained from the Borrower**

> To generate an Income Calculation Report, the Seller must upload the
> Borrower's federal income tax returns to the service provider.
>
> The service provider will then create the Income Calculation Report
> and provide the report to the Seller along with a unique identifying
> reference number assigned to the generated report (the "report ID").
>
> The Seller must then:
>
> 1.Review and verify the Income Calculation Report against information
> in the Mortgage file to determine if any adjustments must be made. If
> so, the Seller must update the Income Calculation Report and upload it
> to the service provider, along with any additional documentation
> necessary to support the updates, or
>
> 2.If an Income Calculation Report is not provided, document the
> calculation of the Borrower's self-employed income on Form 91, Income
> Calculations, or a similar alternative form as described in Section
> 5304.1
>
> 3.Submit to Loan Product Advisor® the report ID number, which will be
> used by Loan Product Advisor to retrieve from the service provider the
> data extracted from the Borrower tax returns. Loan Product Advisor
> will assess this data and return the results of the assessment on the
> Feedback Certificate.

**(b)Income calculations using tax transcripts obtained from a service
provider**

> The Seller must request tax transcripts from a service provider.

> provide the tax transcript to the Seller, along with a unique
> identifying reference number assigned to the generated report (the
> "report ID").
>

>
> 1.Review the tax transcripts and document the calculation of the
> Borrower's self-employed income on Form 91 or a similar alternative
> form as described in Section 5304.1
>
> 2.Submit to Loan Product Advisor the report ID number, which will be
> used by Loan Product Advisor to retrieve from the service provider the
> data extracted from the Borrower's tax transcripts. Loan Product

> the same eligible income source (i.e., business) on the Income
> Calculation Report or Form 91 (or a similar alternative form as
> described in Section 5304.1) for the most recent two years. When the
> Borrower's business has been in existence for less than five years, or
> the Borrower has owned the business for less than five years, the

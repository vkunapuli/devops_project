**5202.5: Adverse or derogatory credit information (11/01/23)**

**(a)Evaluating adverse or derogatory credit information**

> Adverse credit information in and of itself does not mean the
> Borrower's credit reputation is unacceptable. When there is adverse or
> derogatory information in the Borrower's credit history, the Seller
> must determine whether the derogatory information is significant.
>
> For Manually Underwritten Mortgages underwritten using FICO® scores
> with at least two reason codes related to nonpayment of obligations,
> the Seller must presume the derogatory information is significant and
> the Seller must document the extenuating circumstances or conclude
> that the difficulties were due to financial mismanagement. See
> Sections 5202.3 and 5202.4 for additional information regarding the
> requirements necessary to determine a

> Borrower has an acceptable credit reputation for Manually Underwritten
> Mortgages using FICO scores in underwriting.
>
> For all other Manually Underwritten Mortgages with or without FICO
> scores, the Seller must weigh the amount of derogatory information
> against the rest of the credit history and decide whether it is
> significant. In making its determination, the Seller should not ignore
> any derogatory credit, but must give more weight to late housing
> payments and to derogatory information or late payments occurring
> within the past two years. Generally, the more recent the adverse or
> derogatory credit information, the more likely it is significant.
>
> The Seller must consider all of the following:\
> ■The number, timing and extent of the adverse or derogatory credit
> information\
> ■The number, type and size of accounts with adverse or derogatory
> credit information ■Public record information, such as judgments and
> non-medical collection accounts ■Other characteristics listed in this
> section\
> For example, Freddie Mac considers a 30-day late housing payment to
> have more weight than a 30-day late non-housing payment, and a
> non-medical collection account to have more weight than a 30-day late
> payment on a revolving account.
>
> Although there may be many situations involving derogatory credit
> information that are less clear, especially when disputes about
> obligations are involved, the derogatory credit\
> information is not significant when it consists only of isolated late
> payments, even if several accounts show sporadic late payments,
> provided all of the following exist:\
> ■The late payments were not recent\
> ■The late payments did not extend beyond one month\
> ■The number and size of delinquent accounts is not large in relation
> to the overall credit ■The credit history does not show multiple
> revolving accounts with high balances-to-limits or high overall
> utilization of revolving credit\
> ■All other credit has been paid as agreed\
> However, the derogatory information is significant if any of the
> following exist:\
> ■There are several accounts showing recent late payments\
> ■There are multiple 60- or 90-day late payments

> ■There are more than two 30-day or more than one 60-day late housing

>
> ■The number and size of the delinquent accounts are large in relation

>
> ■There are multiple episodes of late payments extending over a period

>
> ■The credit history shows derogatory credit information within the two

>
> ■The public record information reveals several occurrences of

>
> ■There is a bankruptcy, foreclosure, deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, or

>
> Timeshare loans are considered installment debts, regardless of how

> foreclosure recovery time periods for reestablishment of credit below
> do not apply to timeshare loans in foreclosure.
>
> If the Seller decides that the derogatory information is not
> significant, it must provide documentation supporting its conclusion

> **(i)Handling significant adverse or derogatory information caused by
> extenuating** **circumstances for Manually Underwritten Mortgages**
>
> Freddie Mac considers an extenuating circumstance to be a nonrecurring
> or isolated circumstance, or set of circumstances, that was beyond the
> Borrower's control and that significantly reduced income and/or
> increased expenses and rendered the Borrower unable to repay
> obligations as agreed, resulting in significant adverse or derogatory
> credit information.
>
> In addition, if the Borrower's credit history includes significant
> adverse or derogatory credit within the most recent two years, even if
> it was caused by extenuating\
> circumstances, the Borrower's credit reputation cannot be considered
> acceptable.

> When the Seller uses extenuating circumstances to justify that the
> Borrower's credit reputation is acceptable despite significant adverse
> or derogatory information, the Seller must confirm the extenuating

> credit reputation. If the Seller cannot obtain third-party
> documentation confirming the extenuating circumstances and
> reestablishment of credit, it cannot consider the extenuating
> circumstance as an acceptable offset to significant adverse or
> derogatory credit information.

> The Mortgage file must contain all of the following documentation:
>
> ■A written statement from the Borrower, in the form of a signed letter
> or an e-mail directly from the Borrower, attributing the cause of the
> financial difficulties to outside factors beyond the Borrower's
> control that are not ongoing and are unlikely to recur
>
> ■Third-party documentation confirming that the events related by the
> Borrower in the explanation were an isolated occurrence and
> significantly reduced the Borrower's income and/or increased expenses
> and rendered the Borrower unable to repay as agreed
>
> ■An underwriting analysis on Form 1077, Uniform Underwriting and
> Transmittal Summary, or on a separate document in the Mortgage file,

> ❑The events causing the financial difficulties were beyond the

> ❑The Borrower has reestablished an acceptable credit reputation

> ■Evidence on the credit report and other documentation in the Mortgage

> **(ii)Handling significant adverse or derogatory information caused by
> financial** **mismanagement for Manually Underwritten Mortgages**
>
> If the Seller is unable to document extenuating circumstances in
> accordance with Freddie Mac's requirements, then it must conclude that
> the problems were due to financial mismanagement.
>
> In order to conclude that the Borrower's credit reputation is still
> acceptable despite the previous financial mismanagement, the Seller
> must explain on Form 1077 or on a separate document in the Mortgage
> file, the rationale supporting its determination that the financial
> mismanagement is unlikely to recur and the Borrower's credit
> reputation is acceptable. Making a case that the Borrower is
> sufficiently willing to repay obligations when significant derogatory
> information was caused by financial mismanagement is very difficult.
> It will take a longer and more convincing reestablishment period to
> overcome derogatory information caused by financial mismanagement than
> would be needed if the Borrower had experienced financial difficulties
> due to extenuating circumstances.
>
> When the Seller determines that the Borrower's credit reputation is
> acceptable despite significant adverse or derogatory information
> caused by financial mismanagement, the Mortgage file must contain all
> of the following documentation:
>
> ■Evidence that the Borrower has reestablished an acceptable credit
> reputation as required in Topics 5100 and 5200 for Manually
> Underwritten Mortgages
>
> ■Evidence on the credit report and other credit documentation in the
> Mortgage file of the length of time since completion of the
> significant derogatory event to the date of the application, and of
> completion of the recovery time period requirements below. In addition
> to the recovery time period requirements, the following additional\
> requirements below must also be met:

**(b)Documenting Borrower explanation of adverse or derogatory
information**

> As part of its review of Manually Underwritten Mortgages, the Seller
> may need to request that the Borrower provide a written explanation,
> in the form of a signed letter or an e-mail directly from the
> Borrower, of the circumstances causing the payment difficulty. The
> decision to require an explanation letter should be based on such
> factors as the age of the delinquent account, the frequency and
> severity of late payments, the size of the account balance and
> payment, when the late payments occurred and the status of the
> Borrower's other credit accounts.

> For example, a Borrower's credit history shows a 30-day late payment
> on a single charge account ten months ago. The Borrower has several
> other charge accounts, an installment loan and a Mortgage, all showing
> timely payments. The Seller may decide not to obtain a letter of
> explanation. However, if several of the Borrower's credit accounts
> showed late payments, or the Borrower's Mortgage or installment loan
> were also late, the single late on the charge account ten months ago
> may be considered significant, so the Seller should obtain a letter of
> explanation from the Borrower and include it in the Mortgage file.
>
> A written explanation is required for significant derogatory
> information. The purpose for requiring a written explanation is to
> assist the Seller in determining whether the Borrower's credit
> problems were due to extenuating circumstances (factors clearly beyond
> the control of the Borrower) or whether they reflect financial
> mismanagement (the Borrower's disregard for the payment of obligations
> when due).
>
> In order to accomplish this purpose, it may be necessary to allow
> someone to assist the Borrower in preparing the explanation. If the
> Borrower needs assistance in preparing a written explanation, another
> party, such as the real estate agent or loan officer, should be
> encouraged to assist the Borrower in preparing the explanation. As
> long as the explanation accurately reflects the facts as related by
> the Borrower (as evidenced by the Borrower's signature attesting
> accuracy), the Seller should accept the explanation as documentation
> for its review.
>
> A written explanation in and of itself does not satisfy the Seller's
> responsibility to determine the Borrower's willingness to repay. When
> adverse or derogatory information is considered significant, as
> explained in Section 5202.5(a), the Seller must relate the reasons for
> the late payments, as stated by the Borrower, to the other information
> about the Borrower's credit history contained in the Mortgage file.
> The Seller must reasonably be able to conclude that:
>
> ■The explanation is consistent with the adverse information reported
> and the other information in the Mortgage file
>
> ■The explanation establishes a credible cause for the late payments
>
> ■The Borrower represents an acceptable credit risk and exhibits the
> ability and willingness to repay the Mortgage

> Sellers have the option of submitting Form 442, Appraisal Update

>
> Freddie Mac appraisal report forms not listed above must not be
> submitted to the UCDP.
>
> Sellers may use the UCDP as a tool to aid in determining UAD
> compliance. However, the submission of appraisal report forms to the
> UCDP does not relieve the Seller from Freddie Mac appraisal
> requirements, including the requirement that the appraisal must comply
> with Appendix D of the UAD and does not affect Seller representations
> and warranties regarding appraisals and the Mortgaged Premises.
>
> The Seller's ability to select an appraisal management company or
> other party in connection with the use of the UCDP does not constitute
> Freddie Mac's endorsement or approval of the appraisal management
> company or other party and does not relieve Seller of any obligations
> pursuant to the Guide or Seller's other Purchase Documents, including
> the requirements in Section 3101.1 related to the Freddie Mac
> Exclusionary List.

**(c)UCDP messaging**

> When an appraisal report is submitted to the UCDP, the Seller may
> receive a variety of feedback messages designed to assist the Seller
> in evaluating the appraisal report to determine whether it meets the
> requirements of this topic (e.g., the accuracy of the appraiser's
> opinion of market value, UAD compliance, etc.). The Seller should be
> prepared to address these feedback messages as part of their appraisal
> report review and property underwriting process.
>
> For certain Mortgages, the Seller may receive a message indicating the
> appraisal is eligible for collateral representation and warranty
> relief. See Section 5602.2 for more details and eligibility
> requirements related to this representation and warranty relief.
>
> Note: The presence of one or more feedback message(s) with a "warning"
> severity indicator does not prevent the "successful" submission of an
> appraisal report to the UCDP and does not deem the property ineligible
> or the appraisal report unacceptable. In addition, the absence of
> feedback messages does not represent Freddie Mac's acceptance of the
> appraised value or relief from Seller representations and warranties.

**(d)Information and data submitted to the UCDP**

> Freddie Mac and its agents and contractors have the right to use,
> reproduce, modify, disclose, sublicense, distribute and retain all
> information and data submitted to the UCDP and designated for delivery
> to Freddie Mac, including, but not limited to, any field on an
> appraisal report and the contents thereof, all information and data
> entered by Seller or on

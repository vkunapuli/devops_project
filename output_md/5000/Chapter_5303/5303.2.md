■[Employment/income characteristics]{.underline}

■[Income commencing after the Note Date]{.underline}

Primary employment is considered as the Borrower's primary source of
employed income whether derived from employment such as full-time
employment, part-time employment, full-time and/or part-time seasonal
employment.

Secondary employment is considered as any type of employment (e.g.,
second part-time job or multiple jobs) that is in addition to the
Borrower's primary employment.

**(a)Employment history requirements -- primary and secondary
employment**

> **(i) Primary employment**
>
> In most instances, the Borrower should have at least a two-year
> history of primary employment documented on Form 65, Uniform
> Residential Loan Application and verified in accordance with Topic
> 5300.
>
> For Borrowers who are active-duty members of the United States Armed
> Forces, a history of military employment is not required for the
> employment to be considered stable.
>
> The tenure of the Borrower's employment with the same employer or in
> the same or similar industry lends support to the analysis of
> employment stability.
>
> When a Borrower has less than a two-year history of primary
> employment, the Sellermust provide its justification for determining
> that the employment is stable. When making this determination, the
> Seller must take into consideration factors such as income and/or
> employment characteristics and the overall layering of risk factors,
> including the Borrower\'s demonstrated ability to repay obligations.
>
> Examples that may support less than a two-year history of primary
> employment include, but are not limited to, the following:
>
> ■For a Borrower returning to the workforce after a period of extended
> absence, for any reason, documentation is provided to support a stable
> employment history that directly preceded the extended absence

> ■For a Borrower new to the workforce, documentation is provided that
> supports the Borrower's recent attendance at school or in a training
> program prior to their current employment
>
> When the Borrower's employed income is derived from fluctuating hourly
> employment earnings, the Borrower must have at least a 12-month
> history of employment.The required minimum 12-month history must be
> derived from either:
>
> ■The Borrower's current fluctuating hourly employment, or
>
> ■A combination of current and prior fluctuating hourly employment, or
>
> ■A combination of current fluctuating hourly employment and prior
> salaried employment in a similar industry or job type that had an
> income level consistent with the current income levelbased on the
> income trend analysis (see Section 5303.4(d))
>
> **(ii)Secondary employment**
>
> In most instances, the Borrower should have at least a two-year
> history of secondary employment for the employment to be considered
> stable. Under certain circumstances, when a Borrower has less than a
> two-year secondary employment history but has at least a 12-month
> history, the Seller may be able to justify and determine the
> employment is stable. Examples that may support less than a two-year
> history of secondary employment include, but are not limited to, the
> following:
>
> ■The Borrower previously held a job with base non-fluctuating earnings
> working 40 hours per week for multiple years; however, due to reasons
> such as position elimination, work force reduction, or illness, the
> Borrower is no longer employed at this job and is now working at
> multiple part-time jobs that are similar in hours and pay, when
> combined, to the previous full-time job. Since the Borrower's
> full-time employment ended 18 months ago, the length of employment at
> each part-time job is in the range of 13 to 15 months. In this
> scenario, the Seller may be able to justify an employment history of
> less than two years for the secondary and additional jobs provided the
> earnings are consistent and the Borrower has exhibited the ability to
> repay obligations.
>
> ■The Borrower is employed in the educational system as a teacher.
> During the previous summer the Borrower taught summer school within
> the same educational system and is now starting summer school teaching
> for the current year. Although the two-year history is not yet fully
> developed, given the job type and current employment situation, the
> Seller may be able to justify including the summer school income
> provided an accurate qualifying amount can be established and

**(a)General overview**\
A Borrower may receive additional income from employment such as
commission, bonus and overtime pay. Generally, additional employed
income is received in connection with the primary or secondary
employment; however, there are instances where the income is received
through separate sources, such as the military Reserve or National
Guard. If the Seller includes additional employed income to qualify the
Borrower, the Seller must determine that the amount of income used to
qualify the Borrower is stable and complies with the requirements
belowfor each income type. All income must be either expected to
continue or have documented continuance for at least three years as
defined in the topic specific requirements within this section.

The following requirements and guidance are to be used in conjunction
with the requirements and guidance in Section 5301.1.

**(b)Income history and stability -- requirements and guidance**

> Many additional employed income types are fluctuating income. The
> stability of fluctuating income is determined based primarily upon
> historical earnings so it is imperative that a sufficient income
> history has been established. For this reason, most income types that
> fluctuate have a history requirement of two years. In certain
> instances, a shorter history may still be considered stable if the
> Seller provides a written analysis and sufficient supporting
> documentation justifying the determination of stability. When making
> this determination, the Seller must take into consideration factors
> such as income and/or employment characteristics and the overall
> layering of risk factors, including the Borrower's demonstrated
> ability to repay obligations. In no event may the history be less than
> 12 months.
>
> Refer to Section 5303.4 for information with respect to employed
> income calculation requirements and guidance.

**(c)Earnings types for additional employed income**

> **(i)Fixed earnings**
>
> For the purposes of determining stable monthly income, fixed
> additional employed income earnings are considered to be earnings that
> are based on a pre-determined and agreed upon fixed amount of pay that
> is fully documented, such as an automobile allowance, mortgage
> differential or military entitlement(s).
>
> **(ii)Fluctuating earnings**
>
> For the purposes of determining stable monthly income, fluctuating
> additional employed income earnings are considered to be earnings that
> fluctuate on a regular basis, often based on factors such as hours
> worked, job type and performance. Fluctuating earnings may include,
> but are not limited to, income types such as commissions, overtime,
> bonus, tips, Reserve and National Guard, and unemployment compensation
> associated with seasonal employment.
>
> Refer to Section 5303.4 for information with respect to employed
> income calculation requirements and guidance.

**(d)Stable monthly income and documentation requirements for additional

> bonus, overtime, tips), a documented breakdown between the base
> non-fluctuating earnings or fluctuating hourly earnings and the
> additional employed income should be obtained and retained in the

**(a)General overview**\
A Borrower may receive additional income from employment such as
commission, bonus and overtime pay. Generally, additional employed
income is received in connection with the primary or secondary
employment; however, there are instances where the income is received
through separate sources, such as the military Reserve or National
Guard. If the Seller includes additional employed income to qualify the
Borrower, the Seller must determine that the amount of income used to
qualify the Borrower is stable and complies with the requirements
belowfor each income type. All income must be either expected to
continue or have documented continuance for at least three years as
defined in the topic specific requirements within this section.

The following requirements and guidance are to be used in conjunction
with the requirements and guidance in Section 5301.1.

**(b)Income history and stability -- requirements and guidance**

> Many additional employed income types are fluctuating income. The
> stability of fluctuating income is determined based primarily upon
> historical earnings so it is imperative that a sufficient income
> history has been established. For this reason, most income types that
> fluctuate have a history requirement of two years. In certain
> instances, a shorter history may still be considered stable if the
> Seller provides a written analysis and sufficient supporting
> documentation justifying the determination of stability. When making
> this determination, the Seller must take into consideration factors
> such as income and/or employment characteristics and the overall
> layering of risk factors, including the Borrower's demonstrated
> ability to repay obligations. The income history must be at least 12
> months.
>
> Refer to Section 5303.4 for information with respect to employed
> income calculation requirements and guidance.

**(c)Earnings types for additional employed income**

> **(i)Fixed earnings**
>
> For the purposes of determining stable monthly income, fixed
> additional employed income earnings are considered to be earnings that
> are based on a pre-determined and agreed upon fixed amount of pay that
> is fully documented, such as an automobile allowance, mortgage
> differential or military entitlement(s).
>
> **(ii)Fluctuating earnings**
>
> For the purposes of determining stable monthly income, fluctuating
> additional employed income earnings are considered to be earnings that
> fluctuate on a regular basis, often based on factors such as hours
> worked, job type and performance. Fluctuating earnings may include,
> but are not limited to, income types such as commissions, overtime,
> bonus, tips, Reserve and National Guard, and unemployment compensation
> associated with seasonal employment.
>
> Refer to Section 5303.4 for information with respect to employed
> income calculation requirements and guidance.

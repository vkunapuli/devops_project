> requirements must be met:

> 12 months
>
> OR
>
> ■If the Seller is unable to document one of the above requirements for
> each authorized user account, the Seller may make the determination
> that the authorized user accounts have an insignificant impact on the
> Borrower's overall credit history and the information on the credit
> report is representative of the Borrower's own credit reputation. The
> Seller should base its determination on the number of the Borrower's
> own Tradelines, as well as their age, type, size and the payment
> history, as compared to the authorized user\
> accounts. The Seller must document its determination in the Mortgage
> file.

> Loan Product Advisor assessment invalid and manually underwrite the
> Mortgage as a Non-Loan Product Advisor Mortgage.

> requests for new or additional credit. Inquiries made for other
> purposes, such as general solicitations not initiated by the Borrower
> or monitoring inquiries by current creditors, typically are not shown
> on the credit report.

**5604.1: Appraisal report forms, PDRs and inspection types (Future
effective date 04/01/24)**

For each Mortgage transaction that requires an appraisal report or a
PDR, the Mortgage file must contain an appraisal report or PDR that
meets Freddie Mac's requirements to evidence that the Mortgaged Premises
is acceptable collateral. The Seller may provide an appraisal report
that exceeds the minimum collateral assessment requirement indicated by
the Last Feedback Certificate provided the eligibility requirements for
the selected appraisal type are met.

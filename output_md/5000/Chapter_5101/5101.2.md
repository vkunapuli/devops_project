**5101.2: Accuracy of data submitted to Loan Product Advisor®
(07/11/16)**

Because Loan Product Advisor**®** is an automated system, it relies
heavily on information from other sources. Consequently, accurate data
and accurate data entry are critical. The Seller is responsible for the
accuracy and completeness of the data it submits to Loan Product
Advisor. The Seller must ensure that the identifying information for any
Borrower and property (name, current and previous address and Social
Security number and property address) are true, complete and accurate
and that they are properly input into Loan Product Advisor on or before
the Note Date. Except as stated in Chapter 4602 and Section 5101.6, all
data that was submitted to Loan Product Advisor for the Last Feedback
Certificate must be true, complete and accurate, as required by the
Purchase Documents.

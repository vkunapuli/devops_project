**5102.1: Underwriting a Mortgage (02/07/24)**

**(a)Three "Cs" of underwriting**

> Freddie Mac purchases Mortgages that meet standards and requirements
> included in the Guide. Freddie Mac requirements establish the
> information that must be analyzed and documented in the Mortgage file
> and, when applicable, warranted by the Seller for each Mortgage sold
> to Freddie Mac. The conclusion that a Mortgage is acceptable must be
> based on a determination that the Borrower is creditworthy (acceptable
> credit reputation and capacity) and the Mortgaged Premises
> (collateral) is adequate for the transaction. Credit reputation,
> capacity and collateral are often called the "three Cs" of
> underwriting. If one of these components is not acceptable or if there
> is excessive layering of risk across\
> components, the Mortgage is not acceptable for sale to Freddie Mac.
>
> Topics 5100 through 5500 include Freddie Mac's requirements for
> determining that the Borrower has acceptable credit reputation and
> capacity. These topics also cover layering of risk within the three
> components and how to determine excessive layering of risk.
>
> In addition, other specific requirements related to Borrower credit
> reputation and Borrower capacity for special Mortgage products,
> offerings and special features are provided in the following
> locations:

**(b)Underwriting information**\
All information used to evaluate the creditworthiness of the Borrower
must be supported by documentation in the Mortgage file and must be
obtained before, as applicable, the Note Date, or:\
■For Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages, the Effective
Date of Permanent Financing\
■The modification date for Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages\
■The Conversion Date for Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages

Freddie Mac *Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide* Chapter 5102 As of
02/07/24 Page 5102-2

> ■The date of the applicable assumption agreement

**(c)Number of Borrowers**

> Freddie Mac does not limit the number of Borrowers on the Mortgage or
> require that they be related. When multiple Borrowers are involved,
> the overall creditworthiness of each Borrower and all Borrowers
> collectively must be evaluated. The presence of more than one Borrower
> on the Mortgage helps to reduce risk.

**5307.1: Assets as a basis for repayment of obligations (12/01/21)**

Assets that will be used by the Borrower for the repayment of their
monthly obligations may be used to qualify the Borrower for the
Mortgage, provided that, regardless of the underwriting path of the
Mortgage, the requirements of this section are met. Form 65, Uniform
Residential Loan Application, should include information pertaining to
the Borrower's employment and income, even if the Borrower qualifies for
the Mortgage solely based on assets.

**(a)Mortgage eligibility requirements**

> The assets described in this Section 5307.1 may only be used to
> qualify the Borrower if the Mortgage meets all of the following
> requirements:
>
> ■The Mortgage is secured by a 1- or 2-unit Primary Residence or a
> second home
>
> ■The Mortgage is either a purchase transaction Mortgage, "no cash-out"
> refinance Mortgageor Freddie Mac Enhanced Relief Refinance® Mortgage
>
> ■The Mortgage has a maximum loan-to-value (LTV)/total LTV (TLTV)/Home
> Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) TLTV (HTLTV) ratio of 80%, unless the
> Mortgage is an Enhanced Relief Refinance Mortgage, in which case the
> maximum ratios in Section 4304.3 apply

**(b)Asset calculation for establishing the debt payment-to-income
ratio**

> To determine the amount used to establish the debt payment-to-income
> ratio, the Seller must use the net eligible assets (as described
> below), divided by 240.
>
> The amount of net eligible assets is calculated by subtracting the
> following from the total eligible assets:
>
> ■Any funds required to be paid by the Borrower to complete the
> transaction (e.g., Down Payment and Closing Costs),
>
> ■Any gift funds and borrowed funds, and
>
> ■Any portion of assets pledged as collateral for a loan or otherwise
> encumbered

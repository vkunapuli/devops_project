**5601.4: Eligibility of properties with energy efficient improvements
and properties with solar panels (03/31/22)**

**(a)Properties with energy-efficient improvements**

> Energy-efficient features (e.g., photovoltaic systems, water efficient
> improvements, energy-efficient windows) or high-performing
> energy-efficient homes must be identified and any impact to market
> value must be recognized in the appraisal report. The contributory
> value of energy improvements and any premium paid for a
> high-performing energy-efficient home must be measured based on the
> market reaction, similar to any other property feature. Appraisers
> must be familiar with energy reports, energy ratings or other new
> concepts that may be developed to identify the energy efficiency of a
> home. If relied upon, any reports must be generally acceptable and, if
> available, these reports and information must be included in the
> appraisers' analysis.
>
> If the high-performing energy-efficient home or energy improvements
> are new to the market, there may be a lack of sales with similar
> features or a lack of data available from traditional data sources. As
> a result, additional due diligence on behalf of the appraiser may be\
> necessary. The Appraisal Institute's Form 820.05, Residential Green
> and Energy Efficient Addendum, may be used to collect and report
> energy efficiency data associated with a property. When performing the
> analysis to determine the contributory value of the energy efficient
> improvements, the appraiser should consider whether methods such as
> the income approach, cost analysis, discounted cash flows, market
> surveys or any other applicable methods are appropriate. If the
> appraiser's analysis concludes an adjustment is necessary, the
> appraiser must justify and support the analysis and conclusions. This
> information may be included in an addendum or in supplementary
> documentation, if necessary.

**(b)Properties with solar panels**

> Freddie Mac purchases Mortgages secured by properties with solar
> panels. The Seller must take into consideration ownership of the solar
> panels and any liens upon the property relating to debt or lease
> payments used to obtain the solar panels. For example, solar panels
> not owned by the Borrower can be financed via several types of
> agreements such as lease agreements or a power purchase agreement
> (PPA). The Seller must review any UCC-1 Financing Statement or lease
> agreement associated with the solar panels to determine if liens are
> against the real estate or against the solar panels. The property must
> maintain access to electrical utilities consistent with community
> standards.
>
> The Seller must adhere to the following requirements when solar panels
> are present on the Mortgaged Premises based on whether the solar
> panels are leased, financed or owned:

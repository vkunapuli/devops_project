**5601.1: Property eligibility requirements (06/01/22)**

Freddie Mac expects the Seller to place as much emphasis on the adequacy
of the property as collateral as it does on underwriting the Borrower's
creditworthiness. The conclusion that a Mortgage is eligible for sale to
Freddie Mac must be based on the determination that the Borrower is
creditworthy (acceptable credit reputation and capacity) and the
Mortgaged Premises is adequate and acceptable collateral for the
Mortgage transaction. The Seller is responsible for determining the
eligibility of the property and the acceptability of the appraisal
report.

**(a)Eligible properties**

> Freddie Mac will purchase eligible Mortgages secured by residential
> properties in urban, suburban and rural market areas as long as the
